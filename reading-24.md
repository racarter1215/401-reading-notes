# Google Backtracks, Says Its AI Will Not Be Used for Weapons or Surveillance

##### So Artificial Intelligence, along with the upcoming quantum computer, will be the biggest invention of the 21 century. 
##### This article outlines that not only does it's invention hold promise for humans, but also very new and very real dangers.
##### The article is about Google's new pledge to avoid creating AI weapons and have dropped Project Maven, which was considered a project creating said weapons.
##### They further released company guidelines involving AI that was meant to curtail and alleviate concerns their employees and the public may have about AI research and development at Google
##### The problem I have with this, and several interviewed for the article believe as well, is that while an AI project might not be a weapon, it can be used for harm.
##### I concur with the employees that thought the new guidelines weren't enough, and that they should extent their ban on surveillance and data collection AI technologies.

# Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?

##### This article, similar to the above one, deals with the implications of Artificial Intelligence, but focuses on its impact on society as a whole, not just specific applications
##### The article does a pretty good job at showing the possible pitfalls of its use while not becoming too alarmist (though it does use strong terms involving involuntary digital servitude)
##### I feel the article hit the nail on the head when discussing how governments want to use AI to help them condition certain social responses from their population, and companies such as Google and Facebook are central in those efforts
##### It goes further to describe what steps people need to take to get a handle on these technologies and the potential threats they pose, such as having citizens actively participate in decisions involving new and advanced technology applications
##### Overall, this article goes into detail I wish the first one went into. Understanding the dangers posed by AI is one thing, practical steps to alleviate or negate said dangers is another.
