# Inheritance

### one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming.

##### Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.

##### Base class: One whose members are inherited

##### Derived class: One that inherits those members

##### Caution: Structs do not support inheritance, but they can implement interfaces.

##### See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance for example

##### Below is an example of class relationships in C#

// WorkItem implicitly inherits from the Object class.
public class WorkItem
{
    // Static field currentID stores the job ID of the last WorkItem that
    // has been created.
    private static int currentID;

    //Properties.
    protected int ID { get; set; }
    protected string Title { get; set; }
    protected string Description { get; set; }
    protected TimeSpan jobLength { get; set; }

    // Default constructor. If a derived class does not invoke a base-
    // class constructor explicitly, the default constructor is called
    // implicitly.
    public WorkItem()
    {
        ID = 0;
        Title = "Default title";
        Description = "Default description.";
        jobLength = new TimeSpan();
    }

    // Instance constructor that has three parameters.
    public WorkItem(string title, string desc, TimeSpan joblen)
    {
        this.ID = GetNextID();
        this.Title = title;
        this.Description = desc;
        this.jobLength = joblen;
    }

    // Static constructor to initialize the static member, currentID. This
    // constructor is called one time, automatically, before any instance
    // of WorkItem or ChangeRequest is created, or currentID is referenced.
    static WorkItem() => currentID = 0;

    // currentID is a static field. It is incremented each time a new
    // instance of WorkItem is created.
    protected int GetNextID() => ++currentID;

    // Method Update enables you to update the title and job length of an
    // existing WorkItem object.
    public void Update(string title, TimeSpan joblen)
    {
        this.Title = title;
        this.jobLength = joblen;
    }

    // Virtual method override of the ToString method that is inherited
    // from System.Object.
    public override string ToString() =>
        $"{this.ID} - {this.Title}";
}

// ChangeRequest derives from WorkItem and adds a property (originalItemID)
// and two constructors.
public class ChangeRequest : WorkItem
{
    protected int originalItemID { get; set; }

    // Constructors. Because neither constructor calls a base-class
    // constructor explicitly, the default constructor in the base class
    // is called implicitly. The base class must contain a default
    // constructor.

    // Default constructor for the derived class.
    public ChangeRequest() { }

    // Instance constructor that has four parameters.
    public ChangeRequest(string title, string desc, TimeSpan jobLen,
                         int originalID)
    {
        // The following properties and the GetNexID method are inherited
        // from WorkItem.
        this.ID = GetNextID();
        this.Title = title;
        this.Description = desc;
        this.jobLength = jobLen;

        // Property originalItemId is a member of ChangeRequest, but not
        // of WorkItem.
        this.originalItemID = originalID;
    }
}

##### Abstract method: method must be overridden in any non-abstract class that directly inherits from that class. 

##### Virtual method: When a base class declares a method as virtual, a derived class can override the method with its own implementation.

##### Interface: a reference type that defines a set of members.
