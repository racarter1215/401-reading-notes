# Inheritance

### one of the three primary characteristics of object-oriented programming.

##### Inheritance enables you to create new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in other classes.

##### Base class: One whose members are inherited

##### Derived class: One that inherits those members

##### Caution: Structs do not support inheritance, but they can implement interfaces.
