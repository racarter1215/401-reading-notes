# Learn Bootstrap

### Example of bootstrap library implementation:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z" crossorigin="anonymous">

##### Starter Template (HTML 5)
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-JcKb8q3iqJ61gNV9KGb8thSsNjpSL0n8PARn9HuZOnIxN0hoP+VmmDGMN5t9UJ0Z" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

##### Globals for bootstrap implementation:
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>

##### Bootstrap is a mobile first oriented library. Therefore, you need this tag to ensure proper rendering:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

##### Bootstrap uses global box-sizing, which could cause issues with third party vendors on the page. You can override using the following:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
